			<p>We were brainstorming for a hackathon idea and it struck to us that what if we had Virtual Reality classes for subjects like Science and Maths, it would have been amazing. Initially, it was a personal project for us but subsequently, it turned into a startup idea after we researched about its commercial feasibility. We started participating in various startup competitions and started learning about various aspects of startup consortium through them.</p>

			<p class="float-left">Furthermore, we developed our business model, Pitch-deck and learnt about various technical and organizational aspects of a startup. We learnt about the problems being faced by students who have to adopt traditional methodologies to study in schools in this technologically advanced society. And we developed a working prototype and tested it among few students. Through that  we got validation through market and by winning accolades in various competitions. After getting their honest feedback, we started further development on 1st phase of our product.</p>
